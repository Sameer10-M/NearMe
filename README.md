Vellore district lies on the north western side and Tiruvannamalai district lies on the south eastern side of this range. About 50 miles (80 km) wide and 20 miles (32 km) long, they are bisected into eastern and western sections by the Cheyyar and Agaram rivers, tributaries of the Palar. They consist of bluish gray granites, with peaks averaging 3,600–3,800 feet (1,100–1,150 m). The hills are sparsely populated; the majority of the inhabitants are Malayali tribespeople, though other castes are also present. There are many tourist places near Javadhu Hills.
